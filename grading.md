## Grade

| Task                                |   Weight |
| ----------------------------------  | -------: |
| Prototype (oral test)               |     100% |
| **Total**                           | **100%** |

## Assesment
This is an oral test where you present your prototype with your team. You will show how you contributed to the project and explain if you reached your own goals you've set at the beginning of the project. You'll show you can contribute to the prototype in which you applied the subject matter of this course and that you understand it. You'll answer questions in such a way as to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals.

## Preperation
* Bring your computer and a charger.
* Have the latest version of your code ready in your editor.
* Open up your docs inside of your GitHub repository.
* Have a live version up and running.

> Make sure the repository stays online after the oral test is finished, we might want to check the code handed in on GitHub after the test. We also want to download and archive your project when it’s done.

## Publishing
Grades will be published and communicated trough _Email_, _Moodle_ and/or _Slack_ based on student numbers.

* Final grades will be **published** _one week_ after test date.
* Final grades will be put in **SIS** _two weeks_ after test date.

> After the oral test you can request **viewing time** for additional feedback, this can be useful for a resit. Feel free to [contact your lecturer](/readme#synopsis) if you want to do so.

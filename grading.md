## Plagiarism

Regulations (TER) 2017-2018 (in Dutch: Onderwijs- en examenregeling, OER) for
a full definition, but here are a few cases that count as plagiarism:

> correct acknowledgement of sources;
> b. presenting the structure or central ideas developed by someone else as
> your own work or ideas, even when a reference to other authors has been
> included;

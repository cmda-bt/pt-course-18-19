## Coaching

There are no assignments during class, we'll be doing coaching sessions. 

> [Schedule is on slack](https://www.cmda-slack.com)

Make sure you come to the coaching sessions prepared: 

* Bring your Job Stories and Research to the session.
* Think about which topics you want to talk about.
* Think about which questions you want to ask.
* Think about which deliverables you want feedback on.
* Ask other students if they encountered the same problem and look for help.

> These coaching sessions aren't meant to talk about technical problems, it's about your personal progress.

### Questions
Here are some questions you can ask yourself to prepare:

* **Planning**
  * What's you current situation?
  * What's the workload? How much time are you spending on this project?
  * Are you behind schedule? What assignments do you still need to work on?
  * Is it clear when deadlines are?
* **Content**
  * Which courses do you find hard and why?
  * Are there any specific problems you encouter?
* **Agreement**
  * What are the next steps?
  * Which assignments did you finish next time we meet and which problems have you solved?

## Homework

Catch up on the assignments from the previous two weeks. Make sure you've done your user interaction research and started working on your static website. It's best to also feel comfortable using Git through the command line.

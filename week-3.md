## Coaching

There are no assignments during class, we'll be doing coaching sessions. 

> [Time slots are on Moodle](https://moodle.cmd.hva.nl/course/view.php?id=625)

Make sure you come to the coaching sessions prepared: 

* Think about which topics you want to talk about.
* Think about which questions you want to ask.
* Ask other students if they encountered the same problem and look for help.

> These coaching sessions aren't meant to talk about technical problems, it's about your personal progress.

### Questions
Here are some questions you can ask yourself to prepare:

* **Planning**
  * What's you current situation?
  * What's the workload? How much time are you spending on this project?
  * Are you behind schedule? What assignments do you still need to work on?
  * Is it clear when deadlines are?
* **Content**
  * Which courses do you find hard and why?
  * Are there any specific problems you encouter?
* **Agreement**
  * What are the next steps?
  * Which assignments did you finish next time we meet and which problems have you solved?

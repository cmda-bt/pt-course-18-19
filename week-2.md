### II. Run the Command Line

In this assignment you‚Äôll learn the basics of the command line.

#### Synopsis

*   **Practice**
*   **Time**: 0:30h
*   **Goals**: [subgoal 1][s1]
*   **Due**: 3 a.m. the day of [lab 2][w2lab]

#### Tips

*   [Terminal Cheat Sheet for Mac](https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet)
    (**cheat sheet**)
    ‚Äî List of my most used commands and shortcuts in the terminal for Mac
*   Stuck?  See the [Bugs][] section of the course readme to find a list of
    troubleshooting tips

#### Step A

Create a directory on your computer, `run`.  In it, create a file `tutorial.sh`
and copy-paste the complete following document into it.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you are on Windows, make sure the select LF line endings (Unix) instead
> of CRLF (Windows) while saving the file.  In Atom, you can click on CRLF in
> the status bar and switch to LF.  In SublimeText, go to the View menu, and
> click Line Endings.

</details>

* * *

In your terminal, go to the `run` directory and enter it (**hint**: use the
`cd` command to ‚Äúchange directories‚Äù).

If you now run `ls` (to print out files) in the directory, you should see the
tutorial:

```sh
$ ls
# tutorial.sh
```

Now, run the tutorial with `bash tutorial.sh`:

```sh
$ bash tutorial.sh
# Hi! üëã
# Follow this tutorial by running `bash tutorial.sh`.  Stuck?  Use `man` (such
# as `man ls`) in another tab for help!
#
# Results (0/14)
# ‚Ä¶
```

This tutorial is interactive.  Answer any questions it asks you, until it sends
you back here.

#### Step B

Sweet!  Welcome back!  If you completed the tutorial, you were given a code.
Now we‚Äôre going to hand in that code to mark your assignment as complete.
Create an issue on our [GitHub issue tracker][run-issue].
In it, include the **code** you were given.

#### Description

> **Warning**: Don‚Äôt blindly use someones code.  Copy-paste code only if you
> know what it does.  Dotfiles are often very personal: they are often not what
> _you_ want but they can serve as inspiration.

In this course, you‚Äôll find yourself staring at that black screen with green
letters a lot.
You‚Äôll type the same commands over and over again.
As you‚Äôll spend so much time there, it makes sense to make the command line
more useful, and prettier.

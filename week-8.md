> All the Girls by [**@xkcd**][comic-author].

## Survey
We’d like to make this course better, much better, and we’re super interested in what you think of this course! You’d help us enormously by filling out [this survey](https://forms.gle/yHUHBRA1DmNcdfjKA). It should take about **15 minutes** and it can be filled in completely _anonymous_.

## Lab

There are no assignments due next week (or any future week). You can continue working on your prototype for the final assesment.

#### Preparation

Make sure you come to the lab prepared in advance:

* Know which questions you want to ask.
* If you have a bug, investigate and try to make a detailed explanation of your problem.
* Ask other students if they encountered the same problem.

#### Demo

We'll do a live demo or recap a specific topic from previous lessons.

#### Review

During these classes we'll also be reviewing each others code. Make sure you made progress so you have something to get feedback on.

## Assignments

### Reflection

*   **Reflection**
*   **Time**: 1:30h
*   **Goals**: subgoal 9/10

Take about 0:45h to write a _personal reflection_ of this project. 
* If yould take this course again, what would you do different?
* What went well?
* What could be better?
* Did you reach your own learning goals?

Then, take about 0:45h to write a _team reflection_ of this project. 
* How did the communication go?
* Does the project feel finished, did you want to add anything?


## Homework

Next week [**assessment 2**](/assessments/a2.md) will take place. Make sure you come to the assesment prepared in advance:
* Have a look at the [rubic](/grading.md) and **grade yourself**. Bring the filled in rubic to the oral test.
* Check out the [checklist](/grading.md) below the rubic. Did you forget anything?

Presenting your work is a skill all by itself, make sure you prepare yourself properly. The best way is to treat it as [public speaking](https://abookapart.com/products/demystifying-public-speaking) and there are [many books](https://be.noti.st/2018/recommended-books-for-public-speakers) on public speaking available.
* Bring your own computer and a charger.
* Have the latest version of your code ready in your editor.
* Open up your docs inside of your GitHub repository.
* Have a live version up and running.

## Coaching

There are no assignments during class, we'll be doing coaching sessions. 

> [Schedule is on slack](https://www.cmda-slack.com)

Make sure you come to the coaching sessions prepared: 

* Bring your research and wiki to the session.
* Think about which topics you want to talk about.
* Think about which questions you want to ask.
* Think about which deliverables you want feedback on.
* Ask other students if they encountered the same problem and look for help.

> These coaching sessions aren't meant to talk about technical problems, it's about your personal progress.

_This is the last coaching sessions before the oral tests. So make sure your time is well spent._

## Homework

Catch up on the assignments from the previous two weeks. Make sure you've done your _usability tests_, split up your Job Story into a _requirements list_, _implemented your configs_, _customized your editor_ and _code reviewed_ the repository of other students. See [week-4](/week-4.md) and [week-5](/week-5.md). Make sure you document everything in your **wiki**.

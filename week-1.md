### Context & User Interaction

For your project, perform contextual analysis by means of these steps. Make choices right away and define your user context this week. Make sure you verify your choices. Verifying means: displaying your choices to people outside of your class and make sure to get feedback on the feasability of your choices. No large interviews or observational research, but short and hands-on talks. You do need to provide some proof of concept during your assessment at the end of this course. 
You can work in small groups (3-4 students). 

1. Perform a competitor analysis

<details>
  <summary>
    Examples
  </summary>
  - e-matching: usefulness, but not too playful, free + paid (www.e-matching.nl)

- inner circle: only via invite of members, free? (www.theinnercircle.co)
- parship: questionnaire, serious dating, expensive (www.parship.nl)
- happn: find people crossing your path, free? (www.happn.com/en)
- lexa: search, swipe, badges, free + paid (extras) (www.lexa.nl)
- our time (lexa 50+-ers) (www.ourtime.nl)

### Hand in

1. **Create a wiki**  
Instead of putting this research in seperate files or the `readme.md` of your project we would like you to create a [GitHub Wiki](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/#creating-your-wiki) and document your process there. 

1. **Pages:**  
Create a [page](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/#adding-pages) for this week or section of your research. 

1. **Push your changes:**  
Hand in your research in your repository on GitHub under your username.

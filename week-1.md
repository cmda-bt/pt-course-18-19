#### Description

For your project, perform contextual analysis by means of these steps. Make choices right away and define your user context this week. Make sure you verify your choices. Verifying means: displaying your choices to people outside of your class and make sure to get feedback on the feasability of your choices.

You can work in small groups (3-4 students).

1. **Pages:**  
Create a [page](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/#adding-pages) for this week or section of your research.

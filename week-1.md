## Assignments

[![][comic-cover]][comic-link]

> Angular Momentum by [**@xkcd**][comic-author].

You‚Äôre expected to spend about 6 hours on assignments outside of class.
Submit your assignments by 3 a.m. the day of [lab 2][w2lab].

### Assignments Context & User Interaction

For your project, perform contextual analysis by means of these steps. Make choices right away and define your user context this week. Make sure you verify your choices. Verifying means: displaying your choices to people outside of your class and make sure to get feedback on the feasability of your choices. No large interviews or observational research, but short and hands-on talks. You do need to provide some proof of concept during your assessment at the end of this course. 
You can work in small groups (3-4 students). 

##### Perform a competitor analysis

</details>

* * *

In your terminal, go to the `run` directory and enter it (**hint**: use the
`cd` command to ‚Äúchange directories‚Äù).

If you now run `ls` (to print out files) in the directory, you should see the
tutorial:

```sh
$ ls
# tutorial.sh
```

Now, run the tutorial with `bash tutorial.sh`:

```sh
$ bash tutorial.sh
# Hi! üëã
# Follow this tutorial by running `bash tutorial.sh`.  Stuck?  Use `man` (such
# as `man ls`) in another tab for help!
#
# Results (0/14)
# ‚Ä¶
```

This tutorial is interactive.  Answer any questions it asks you, until it sends
you back here.

#### Step B

Sweet!  Welcome back!  If you completed the tutorial, you were given a code.
Now we‚Äôre going to hand in that code to mark your assignment as complete.
Create an issue on our [GitHub issue tracker][run-issue].
In it, include the **code** you were given.

#### Description

> **Warning**: Don‚Äôt blindly use someones code.  Copy-paste code only if you
> know what it does.  Dotfiles are often very personal: they are often not what
> _you_ want but they can serve as inspiration.

In this course, you‚Äôll find yourself staring at that black screen with green
letters a lot.
You‚Äôll type the same commands over and over again.
As you‚Äôll spend so much time there, it makes sense to make the command line
more useful, and prettier.
